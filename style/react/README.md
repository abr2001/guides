# React

 * Start new projects with [react-suspenders]
 * Use React in [Strict Mode]
 * Use React with [TypeScript](../typescript/README.md)
 * Use [Jest](../testing-jest/README.md) for unit testing
 * Use [styled-components] for CSS-in-JS
 * Use [Apollo] with [code generation] when working with [GraphQL]
 * Use [React Router] for routing in SPAs
 * Avoid deeply nested routing when using React Router
 * Prefer [Function Components] over [Class Components]
 * Prefer keeping a single component in each file
 * Use `PascalCase` for component names and their file names
 * Use [React Hooks]
 * Use pre-built hooks when possible (e.g. [streamich/react-use])
 * Use [custom hooks] to encapsulate stateful logic outside a component
 * Avoid [Forwarding Refs]
 * Avoid [Higher-Order Components] and [recompose]. See hooks above as an alternative.
 * Prefer the `children` prop over [render props]
 * Prefer using [TypeScript prop interfaces] over [PropTypes]
 * Prefer the [short syntax] when using [Fragments]
 * Prefer [React Contexts] over [Redux]
 * Prefer [Controlled Components] over [Uncontrolled Components]
 * Avoid using indexes as the value for [keys]
 * Prefer [component composition over component inheritance]
